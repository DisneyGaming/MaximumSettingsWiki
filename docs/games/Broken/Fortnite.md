## Status - <span style="color:red">Broken</span>
Fortnite uses a Anti-Cheat called [Easy Anti-Cheat](https://www.easy.ac/en-us/) which is not supported on Linux. This means that the game will not launch. There are no known workarounds at this time. It is confirmed that Fortnite will not support Linux in the future.
