Gaming on MaximumSettings and Linux in general can generally be hit and miss. This is due to the fact that most games are not made with Linux in mind and therefore do not support it. This page includes some popular games and their status on MaximumSettings.

The status of each game may change over time as new updates are released for the game or for the software used to run the game. So please check back here often to see if the game you wish to play is changes.
