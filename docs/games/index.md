# Games
When Gaming on MaximumSettings there are certain things to keep in mind. Games which require things like Anti-Cheat have a higher chance to not work. Not every game will work on Linux due to how different the software is compared to something like Windows. This does not mean that it is impossible to play your game there are options. Below will be popular games which either don't work or work with workarounds.

Gaming works by using a piece of software called [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/). WINE is a translation layer which converts specific Windows code to Linux emkxecutable code by replacing the libraries needed with their own. This is then combined with a another piece of software called a wrapper which adds extra features like DirectX Support, Vulkan Support and most importantly certain support for anti-cheats. This allows to run Windows applications and games on Linux with some performance impact.
