This wiki is for the purposes of helping new and old users use their MaximumSettings machines.

This wiki will hold what is deemed necessary to help users with their cloud machine ranging from simple application alternatives when using Linux to help with getting games with Anti-Cheats to work as intended.

All information on this website is subject to change at anytime but should remain up to date with changes pushed towards your Cloud Machine.

Please be aware that this service is in beta so all software and hardware used at MaximumSettings is subject to change.
